title.sub=What is Gente?
gente.1=Gente is a derivative of the game PENTE, invented in 1978 by Gary Gabrel. \
Like Gabrel's Pente, Gente uses a simple, grid based board with players using different colored round pieces as \
they move across the board.
gente.2=Unlike Pente, Gente is a game played by 4 players, on two teams.  In this implementation we call those two \
teams "hot" and "cold."  In Gente, team-members have the ability to "co-operate" or to "defect.
move.title=First move
move=The first move is always to the center square, marked by a red star on the board.
win.title=How to win?
win= In order to win, you need to either:  a) line up three of your own color stones in a row twice or b) join your \
tokens with your teammate's tokens to create four stones in a row, three times.  A line of three of your own tokens \
is called a "tria", while a line of four of yours and your teammate's tokens is called a "tessera."  Players can \
score 5 or 10 points a game, depending on the winning configuration.
rules.title=Rules of Gente
rules.list=<li>Uses a 19 x 19 Go Board</li>\
<li>4 Players divided into 2 teams</li>\
<li>10 points awarded per game</li>\
<li>Yellow must go first, and move to the center square</li>\
<li>Players are not allowed to capture the opposing team's tokens</li>\
<li>2 trias, that player awarded all 10 points</li>\
<li>3 tesseras, both players awarded 5 points</li>
strategy.title=Strategy
strategy.1= A "tria" (three stones in a row of the same color) and a "tessera" (four stones in a row of team colors) \
may be mixed; so an ideal strategy is to strive first for a mixed tria/tessera and continue playing.
strategy.2= In our research, we have identified the following three successful strategies, two of which have been \
implemented in AI (but not yet made generally available):
strategy.list= <li>Blocker</li>\
<li>Simple</li>\
<li>Mixed</li>
strategy.blocker=The "Blocker" strategy is used to block winning moves of the opposing team.  For example, if a player \
on the opposing team has only one end open on a two-stone formation of his own color, than a "blocker" strategy \
would be to place your token down in that empty spot, thereby disallowing the opposing team-member from scoring.
strategy.simple=The "Simple" strategy is to pursue scoring moves for your own color or your own team as they become \
available on the board.  Players look for the next move they can make to become closer to the type of win they desire \
(solitary or team-based).
strategy.mixed= The "Mixed" strategy is to combine both "Blocker" and "Simple", with the player either seeking to \
block his opponents, if he/she feels threatened, or by seeking to score either in a solitary or team-based manner.
